<h1>Why farts funny</h1>
<h2>Spoiler alert, it's because they are.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. They make a funny sound.</h3>
<p>A fart makes an absolutely ridiculous sound. <br />
It's truly unbelievable that you have the power to subject those around you(even strangers if you so dare) to the sound
 of your flatulence.</p>
<h3>2. They stink!</h3>
<p> After horrifying strangers at the grocery store witness the sound of a sonic raspberry, you
     now subject them to the foulest thing they've probably smelled all week. You did that, and that's hilarous. </p>
<h3>3. They come out of YOUR BUTT </h3>
<p>Are you kidding me?? This is the cherry on top. Foul smelling sound from a foul, smelly place. </p>
